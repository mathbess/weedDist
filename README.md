# weedDisp

Project to publish my Master's thesis on modeling weed dispersal in agriculture.

The objective of this repository is to make the paper reproducible from data to manuscript by using automated and version control system. This repo is based in the template that was kindly shared by TimothÃ©e Poisot [here][tp].

The paper is under development. If you want to take a look in the progress, the manuscript pdf is [here][pdf].
